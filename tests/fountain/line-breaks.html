<p>Murtaugh, springing hell bent for leather -- and folks, grab your hats … because just then, a BELL COBRA HELICOPTER crests the edge of the bluff.</p>
<p>An explosion of sound…<br />
As it rises like an avenging angel …<br />
Hovers, shattering the air with turbo-throb, sandblasting the hillside with a roto-wash of loose dirt, tables, chairs, everything that’s not nailed down …</p>
<p>Screaming, chaos, frenzy.<br />
Three words that apply to this scene.</p>

<p>SCANNING THE AISLES 2…</p>
<p>No luck. He has no choice to deal the cards.</p>
