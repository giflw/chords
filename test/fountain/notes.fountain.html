[[It was supposed to be Vietnamese, right?]]

JACK [[in Vietnamese, subtitled]]: Did you know Brick and Steel are retired



His hand is an inch from the receiver when the phone RINGS.
Scott pauses for a moment, suspicious for some reason.[[This
section needs work. Either that, or I need coffee. (two spaces next line)
  
Definitely coffee.]] He looks around. Phone ringing.

Here [[we concatenate using asterisk
**
as example]]


And here [[we break a note line
as example]]
